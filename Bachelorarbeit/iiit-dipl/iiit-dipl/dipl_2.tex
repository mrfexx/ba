The introduced model allows to estimate the temperature at different points in the patient's body and on its surface. To evaluate the accuracy the arterial, the venous and the nasal temperature of the patient as well as the room temperature has been recorded during cardiac surgeries and compared to the results of the simulation. Although external sources of heat have not been taken into account so far, the occurring deviations were less than
